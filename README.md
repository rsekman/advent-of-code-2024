# Advent of Code 2024

I'm using Advent of Code 2024 to learn some Rust.

Each day will have its own binary with a matching name and will read its input from `input/DD`.
To build and run the programs [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/):
```sh
# Build and run today's puzzle
just run
# Build and run the program for puzzle DD
just run DD
```
